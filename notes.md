### Split NN



Split Learning is proposed in the scenario of multiple regular arithmetic nodes (Alices) + one super arithmetic node (Bob). The core idea is that all parties train a complete model together without leaking the original data, while arranging the parts of the model with higher computational load at the Bob node. The introduction to Split Learning is generally developed based on the distributed computing architecture SplitNN.

Here. We would use 3 maybe.
